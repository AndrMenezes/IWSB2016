## Behaviour of Likelihood Ratio, Wald and Score statistics in small samples for Beta distribution
In this work we investigated the finite-sample behaviour of the Likelihood Ratio, Wald and Score statistics
used in hypothesis tests concerning the parameters of Beta distribution under the parametrization proposed by 
[Ferrari and Cribari-Neto (2004)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0266476042000214501)
